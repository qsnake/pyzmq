Tornado Eventloop with PyZMQ
============================

Facebook's `Tornado`_ includes an eventloop for handing poll events on filedescriptors and
native sockets. We have included a small part of Tornado (specifically its
:mod:`.ioloop`), and adapted its :class:`IOStream` class into :class:`.ZMQStream` for
handling poll events on Ã˜MQ sockets. A ZMQStream object works much like a Socket object,
but instead of calling :meth:`~.Socket.recv` directly, you register a callback with
:meth:`~.ZMQStream.on_recv`. callbacks can also be registered for send and error events
with :meth:`~.ZMQStream.on_send` and :meth:`~.ZMQStream.on_err` respectively.


:func:`install()`
-----------------

With PyZMQ's ioloop, you can use zmq sockets in any tornado application.  You must first
install PyZMQ's :class:`.IOLoop`, with the :func:`.ioloop.install` function:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from zmq.eventloop import ioloop
    ioloop.install()

This replaces :class:`tornado.ioloop.IOLoop` with our IOLoop class.
The reason this must happen is that tornado objects avoid having to pass the active
IOLoop instance around, by having a staticmethod :meth:`.IOLoop.instance`,
which always returns the active instance.  If PyZMQ's IOLoop is installed after
the first call to :meth:`IOLoop.instance()` (called in almost every tornado object constructor),
then there will likely be two IOLoops created, only one of which will ever run.
The symptom of failing to install the zmq eventloop at all, or too late,
will be utter silence - a subset of your handlers (the ones attached to the IOLoop
that didn't get started) will simply never be called.

.. note::

    It *should* be possible to use the IOLoop with tornado without :func:`ioloop.install`,
    but it would require passing the `io_loop` argument to every constructor, which is
    exactly what the :meth:`instance` method is for, and even then might not work.


:meth:`send`
------------

ZMQStream objects do have :meth:`~.ZMQStream.send` and :meth:`~.ZMQStream.send_multipart`
methods, which behaves the same way as :meth:`.Socket.send`, but instead of sending right
away, the :class:`.IOLoop` will wait until socket is able to send (for instance if ``HWM``
is met, or a ``REQ/REP`` pattern prohibits sending at a certain point). Messages sent via
send will also be passed to the callback registered with :meth:`~.ZMQStream.on_send` after
sending.

:meth:`on_recv`
---------------

:meth:`.ZMQStream.on_recv` is the primary method for using a ZMQStream. It registers a
callback to fire with messages as they are received, which will *always* be multipart,
even if its length is 1. You can easily use this to build things like an echo socket:

.. sourcecode:: python

    s = ctx.socket(zmq.REP)
    s.bind('tcp://localhost:12345')
    loop = ioloop.IOLoop.instance()
    stream = ZMQStream(s, loop)
    def echo(msg):
        stream.send_multipart(msg)
    stream.on_recv(echo)
    loop.start()

on_recv can also take a `copy` flag, just like :meth:`.Socket.recv`. If `copy=False`, then
callbacks registered with on_recv will receive tracked Message objects instead of bytes.

:meth:`flush`
-------------

Sometimes with an eventloop, there can be multiple events ready on a single iteration of
the loop. The :meth:`~.ZMQStream.flush` method allows developers to pull messages off of
the queue to enforce some priority over the event loop ordering. flush pulls any pending
events off of the queue. You can specify to flush only recv events, only send events, or
any events, and you can specify a limit for how many events to flush in order to prevent
starvation.
